# ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING - EASPA
Consumer shopping behaviour generally lacks awareness about the sustainability of a product , especially product packaging which has a huge impact on our environment. So even if consumers want to do their bit for the environment , thereâ€™s little to no model available to provide them with a comprehensive overview about the sustainability of a product . Research in this area is still in its nascent phase and few mathematical frameworks have been developed or are in the development phase. 
The lack of fixed parameters for determining the sustainability of product packaging , motivated us to develop a fuzzy based ecommerce model. A lot of product packaging assessment data is available but scattered. We reviewed several such literature on packaging assessment and decided on some common parameters that would form our fuzzy set
Our objective was to find data spread throughout the internet about sustainability factors like carbon footprint, amount of water used, amount of waste treated, recyclability for various products and provide users the option to shop for objects which are environmentally friendly.
